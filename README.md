### Backend / API Development / Cloud

- _Problem Set 1: De-dupe union lists_
  _ Small
  _ Create a single API endpoint that accepts a list of lists of strings `[[string]]` and returns a single list containing all unique strings from the input lists (i.e. union, de-duped).
  _ Medium
  _ Create an API endpoint that accepts a list of list of strings `[[string]]` with a name and stores that list, and another endpoint that accepts a list of named lists and returns the de-duped union of those named lists. (storage does not need to persist between application launches)
  _ Large
  _ Use a real persistence layer (i.e. non-application memory-based, non-file-system based)
  _ Extra-Large
  _ Deploy it in the cloud and make it accessible to other users.
